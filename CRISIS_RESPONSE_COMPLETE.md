## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Production Deployment Readiness** (0-2 hours):
1. **Run production validation**: `npm run stability-check`
2. **Verify edge functions**: Use monitoring tools to check production
3. **Test file upload system**: Validate with real production data
4. **Monitor system health**: Use real-time dashboard

### **Code Freeze Management** (Ongoing):
1. **Only critical fixes allowed** until all criteria met
2. **Use monitoring dashboard** for real-time status
3. **Regular health checks** every 2-4 hours
4. **Document any emergency changes** in stabilization status

### **Progressive Unfreezing** (2-4 hours):
1. **Validate all success criteria** are met
2. **Document system stability** confirmation
3. **Plan gradual development resumption**
4. **Update team on new development guidelines**

---

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **If Critical Issues Arise**:
1. Check `SYSTEM_STABILIZATION_STATUS.md` for current status
2. Run `npm run stability-check` for diagnosis
3. Use SystemHealthStatus component for real-time monitoring
4. Document any emergency fixes in stabilization log

### **For Production Deployment**:
1. Ensure `npm run pre-deploy` passes
2. Verify all health checks are green
3. Confirm code freeze compliance
4. Monitor system during deployment
