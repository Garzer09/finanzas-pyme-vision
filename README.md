## ðŸ§ª Testing and Validation

This project includes a comprehensive testing and validation system designed for production readiness.

### Available Test Scripts

#### Core Testing Commands
```sh
# Run all unit and integration tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

#### Validation Scripts
```sh
# Comprehensive stability check for production readiness
npm run stability-check

# Pre-deployment validation (includes stability check + build)
npm run pre-deploy

# Validate authentication system
npm run validate:auth

# Validate navigation and routing
npm run validate:navigation

# Validate error recovery and resilience
npm run validate:recovery

# Run all validation checks
npm run validate:all
```

### Test Structure

The project uses a dual testing approach:

#### 1. Component-Level Tests (`src/components/__tests__/`)
- Detailed tests for specific components and functionality
- Authentication flows and security validation
- Session management and role detection
- Error recovery and network resilience
- End-to-end user journeys

#### 2. Base Test Suites (`tests/`)
- **`tests/auth.test.ts`** - Authentication system base tests
- **`tests/navigation.test.ts`** - Navigation and routing base tests
- **`tests/error-recovery.test.ts`** - Error recovery and resilience base tests
- **`tests/stability.test.ts`** - System stability and performance base tests

### Testing Configuration

The project uses **Vitest** for unit/integration testing and **Playwright** for E2E testing:

- **Vitest Config**: `vitest.config.ts` - Optimized for comprehensive coverage
- **Playwright Config**: `playwright.config.ts` - Configured for robust E2E testing
- **Coverage Thresholds**: 70% minimum coverage for production readiness

### Validation Scripts Details

#### Stability Check (`npm run stability-check`)
Comprehensive validation including:
- âœ… Code freeze status verification
- âœ… Complete test suite execution
- âœ… Build process validation
- âœ… Environment configuration check
- âœ… Critical file presence verification
- âœ… Authentication system validation
- âœ… Security configuration check
- âœ… Error boundary validation

#### Authentication Validation (`npm run validate:auth`)
Specialized validation for:
- Authentication flows (login/logout)
- Session management
- Role detection and permissions
- Security validation features
- Production security measures

#### Navigation Validation (`npm run validate:navigation`)
Validates:
- Navigation flow tests
- End-to-end user journeys
- Routing protection mechanisms
- Accessibility compliance
- User experience flows

#### Error Recovery Validation (`npm run validate:recovery`)
Tests:
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Network resilience
- Timeout and retry logic
- Error boundaries implementation
- Fallback component coverage

### Test Coverage Requirements

For production deployment, the following coverage thresholds must be met:
- **Lines**: 70%
- **Functions**: 70%
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Statements**: 70%

### Running Tests in CI/CD

All validation scripts are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

```sh
# Set CI environment variable for optimal test execution
export CI=true

# Run comprehensive validation
npm run validate:all
```

### Development Testing Workflow

1. **During Development**: `npm test` for rapid feedback
2. **Before Commit**: `npm run test:coverage` to ensure coverage
3. **Before Push**: `npm run validate:all` for comprehensive validation
4. **Pre-Production**: `npm run stability-check` for deployment readiness

## Environment Configuration

### Supabase Edge Functions

The project includes Supabase Edge Functions that require environment configuration:

- **DENO_ENV**: Set to `development` for development mode, or any other value for production mode
  - In development mode (`DENO_ENV=development`), edge functions use mock data for testing
  - In production mode, edge functions should use real data processing

To configure environment variables for Supabase Edge Functions:
```sh
# For local development
supabase secrets set DENO_ENV=development

# For production deployment  
supabase secrets set DENO_ENV=production
```
