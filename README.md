### üîê Authentication Testing System

The project includes a comprehensive authentication testing system with automated test user creation and validation.

#### Quick Start - Authentication Testing

1. **Create Test Users**:
   ```sh
   npm run create-test-users
   ```

2. **Run Authentication Tests**:
   ```sh
   npm run test:auth
   ```

3. **Manual Testing Credentials**:
   - **Admin User**: `admin@test.finanzas-pyme.com` / `AdminTest123!`
   - **Viewer User**: `viewer@test.finanzas-pyme.com` / `ViewerTest123!`

#### Authentication Test Coverage

The authentication test suite validates:
- ‚úÖ **Login/Logout Flows**: Success and failure scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin vs viewer permissions
- ‚úÖ **Session Management**: Token refresh, concurrent sessions
- ‚úÖ **Security Features**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ **Password Security**: Validation, reset flows, brute force protection
- ‚úÖ **Permission Enforcement**: Route protection, data access controls

### üöÄ CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Unit Tests**: Multi-Node.js version testing (18.x, 20.x)
- **Component Tests**: React component validation
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing with database
- **E2E Tests**: Browser-based testing across platforms  
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle analysis and load time validation
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and code analysis

### üìä Test Fixtures and Utilities

#### Financial Data Fixtures (`tests/fixtures/financial-data.ts`)
```typescript
import { mockFinancialEntry, mockBalanceSheet } from '@tests/fixtures/financial-data';

// Pre-built test data for consistent testing
const testEntry = createMockFinancialEntry({
  debit: 1000,
  account: 'Custom Account'
});
```

#### Mock Services (`tests/__mocks__/`)
- **Supabase Client**: Database operations and authentication
- **File System**: Upload/download simulation
- **Template Service**: Configuration and template processing

### üìà Performance and Security Testing

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Bundle Size Analysis**: Automated size tracking and optimization recommendations
- **Load Time Testing**: Performance regression detection

#### Environment Requirements for Testing

```env
# Required in .env file
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional: Enable debug mode
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true

```

### Test Structure

The project uses a dual testing approach:

#### 1. Component-Level Tests (`src/components/__tests__/`)
- Detailed tests for specific components and functionality
- Authentication flows and security validation
- Session management and role detection
- Error recovery and network resilience
- End-to-end user journeys

#### 2. Base Test Suites (`tests/`)
- **`tests/auth.test.ts`** - Authentication system base tests
- **`tests/navigation.test.ts`** - Navigation and routing base tests
- **`tests/error-recovery.test.ts`** - Error recovery and resilience base tests
- **`tests/stability.test.ts`** - System stability and performance base tests

### Testing Configuration

The project uses **Vitest** for unit/integration testing and **Playwright** for E2E testing:

- **Vitest Config**: `vitest.config.ts` - Optimized for comprehensive coverage
- **Playwright Config**: `playwright.config.ts` - Configured for robust E2E testing
- **Coverage Thresholds**: 70% minimum coverage for production readiness

- **Statements**: 70%

### Running Tests in CI/CD

All validation scripts are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

```sh

export CI=true

# Run comprehensive validation
npm run validate:all
```

### Development Testing Workflow

1. **During Development**: `npm test` for rapid feedback
2. **Before Commit**: `npm run test:coverage` to ensure coverage
3. **Before Push**: `npm run validate:all` for comprehensive validation
4. **Pre-Production**: `npm run stability-check` for deployment readiness

## Environment Configuration

### Supabase Edge Functions

The project includes Supabase Edge Functions that require environment configuration:

- **DENO_ENV**: Set to `development` for development mode, or any other value for production mode
  - In development mode (`DENO_ENV=development`), edge functions use mock data for testing
  - In production mode, edge functions should use real data processing

To configure environment variables for Supabase Edge Functions:
```sh
# For local development
supabase secrets set DENO_ENV=development

# For production deployment  
supabase secrets set DENO_ENV=production
```
